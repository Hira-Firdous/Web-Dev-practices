Challenge 1

1. const myBoolean='true';
2. const myString ='hello world';
3. const firstNumber='20';
4. let secondNumber='40';
5. secondNumber='80';
6. const myArray =[myBoolean, myString];
7. const myObject ={
	FirstProperty: myArray,
	sumProperty: fisrtNumber+SecondNumber
		}
8. console.log(myObject)
9. console.log(myObject.sumProperty)
10. console.log(myObject.FirstProperty[0])

Challenge 2
firstly there is spacing in the initialization of our variable. secondly there is no ";" in second line and thirdly as the variable is being declared afterwards so use of let insead of const

Challenge 3
it will be equal to 2040 cause an int is being added to a string. The data type of it will be string.


Challenge 4
In the declaration of object ";" is being used. where as ";" is use at the end of a line. So this is not valid cause it should be ","

for the editing:
const objectVariable = {
  property1: 'i am property 1',
  property2: 'i am property 2',
  property3: [20, 30, 40]
};

console.log(objectVariable.property3[2]);

it should be like this.


Challenge 5
This code does not work cause the index use for elemt accessing is not valid. The value at that index does not exist.


the correct solution will be:
const myArray = [20, 30, 40];

console.log(myArray[2]);
